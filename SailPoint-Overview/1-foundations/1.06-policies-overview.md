# 🏆 Section 1.06 | Foundations | “Policies Overview”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
Policies in SailPoint are the **rules that enforce governance and compliance**.  
They define what is allowed, what is not, and how exceptions are handled.  
Without policies, an identity system becomes just automation with no guardrails.

## 🏢 Core Explanation

### Types of Policies
1. **Separation of Duties (SoD) Policies**  
   - Prevent toxic combinations of access (e.g., cannot both create and approve payments).  

2. **Account Policies**  
   - Define acceptable account states (e.g., no shared accounts, must have unique usernames).  

3. **Risk Policies**  
   - Identify high-risk access patterns (e.g., admin rights in sensitive apps).  

4. **Activity Policies** (mainly in ISC)  
   - Monitor and flag risky behaviors or unusual activities.  

### Why Policies Matter
- Enforce **regulatory compliance** (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).  
- Reduce **insider threat risks**.  
- Ensure **business rules** are applied consistently.

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Policy Catalog** → central list of all active policies.  
- **Policy Violations** → instances where identities break the rule.  
- **Remediation Workflows** → process to fix violations (remove access, approve exceptions).  
- **Reports and Certifications** → provide evidence to auditors.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
[ Identity / Access Assignment ]
             |
       Evaluated Against
         [ Policies ]
             |
    ----------------------
    |        |           |
  Pass    Violation   Exception Request
```

- When access is assigned, policies are evaluated.  
- If rules are broken, violations are logged.  
- Violations can trigger automatic revocation, exception requests, or certification reviews.

## 🌍 Real-World Example
A finance user is given two roles:  
- *Role 1*: Create Vendor Payments  
- *Role 2*: Approve Vendor Payments  

An SoD policy detects this conflict.  
- SailPoint flags a violation.  
- The system either blocks the assignment or routes it for manager/exceptions approval.  

---

## 🔍 ISC Focus vs IIQ Touchpoint
- **ISC (Identity Security Cloud)** → Policies are SaaS-driven, with activity-based monitoring and prebuilt risk templates. Strong out-of-the-box dashboards.  
- **IIQ (IdentityIQ)** → Policies are customizable with Beanshell rules, often more complex to configure, but provide deeper control in on-premise deployments.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Too many policies created at once | Overwhelms teams and leads to ignored violations |
| Weak remediation workflows | Violations pile up without resolution |
| Skipping SoD design | High audit and compliance risks |
| Lack of policy owners | No accountability for maintaining rules |

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What are the main types of policies in SailPoint?  
2. What happens when a policy violation occurs?  
3. How does ISC handle policies differently from IIQ?  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
Policies are the **guardrails of SailPoint**, ensuring compliance, detecting risky access, and preventing toxic combinations. They keep automation safe and auditable.
