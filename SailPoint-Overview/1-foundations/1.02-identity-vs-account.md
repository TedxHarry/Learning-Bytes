# 🏆 Section 1.02 | Foundations | “Identity vs Account”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
In SailPoint, one of the most important distinctions to understand early is the difference between an **Identity** and an **Account**.  
Confusing these terms leads to misconfigurations, compliance issues, and failed automation.  

---

## 🏢 Core Explanation
### Identity
- Represents a **person** (employee, contractor, partner) in SailPoint  
- Aggregates all accounts belonging to that person across connected systems  
- The **central object** in Identity Security Cloud (ISC) and IdentityIQ (IIQ)  

### Account
- Represents **credentials or presence** of the identity in a specific application or system  
- Example: A single user may have one account in Active Directory, another in Salesforce, and another in ServiceNow  

### Key Difference
- **Identity = Who the person is**  
- **Account = Where that person exists in connected systems**  

---

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Identity Attributes** → name, email, department, manager, etc.  
- **Account Attributes** → username, account ID, entitlements, status (enabled/disabled).  
- **Correlation Rules** → logic that links accounts to the right identity.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
[ HR System ] ---> [ SailPoint Identity ]
                        |
                +-------+-------+
                |               |
       [Account in AD]    [Account in Salesforce]
```

- HR system provides authoritative data for the identity  
- SailPoint builds the identity object  
- Correlation rules link accounts in AD, Salesforce, and others back to that identity  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
A contractor named **Alex** works in IT:  
- Identity in SailPoint: Alex (name, email, department: IT)  
- Accounts:  
  - `alex.smith` in Active Directory  
  - `asmith` in Salesforce  
  - `alex_it` in ServiceNow  
- SailPoint stitches these accounts to the **single identity** → Alex  

This ensures all access belongs to the right person, not scattered across systems.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Treating accounts as identities | Leads to duplicates and poor governance |
| Weak correlation rules | Risk of orphan or mismatched accounts |
| Over-reliance on usernames only | Usernames may differ across systems, causing missed links |

---

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What does an **identity** represent in SailPoint?  
2. What does an **account** represent?  
3. Why are correlation rules critical?  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
An **identity** represents the person. **Accounts** are the footprints of that identity in different systems. Linking them correctly is the foundation of SailPoint governance.
