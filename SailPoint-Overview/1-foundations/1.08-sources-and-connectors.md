# 🏆 Section 1.08 | Foundations | “Sources and Connectors”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
For SailPoint to manage identities and access, it needs to **connect to external systems** where accounts and entitlements live.  
This is done through **sources** and **connectors**.  
- A **source** is any application or system SailPoint integrates with.  
- A **connector** is the technical component that makes the integration work.  

Understanding these is essential because they form the **bridge between SailPoint and the enterprise systems** it governs.

## 🏢 Core Explanation

### Sources
- Systems where user accounts, groups, or entitlements exist.  
- Examples: Active Directory, Workday, Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP.  
- Can be **authoritative** (feeding identity data, e.g., HR system) or **non-authoritative** (providing additional accounts/entitlements).  

### Connectors
- Prebuilt or custom integrations that link SailPoint with sources.  
- Handle aggregation (reading accounts/entitlements) and provisioning (creating/updating/removing accounts).  
- Types of connectors:  
  - **Out-of-the-box connectors** → provided by SailPoint for common systems (AD, Workday, Okta).  
  - **Standard connectors (REST, JDBC, SCIM)** → flexible connectors for systems that follow industry protocols.  
  - **Custom connectors** → built when no standard option exists.  

### Why This Matters
Without connectors, SailPoint would be a silo. With them, it becomes the **central brain** of identity governance.

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Aggregation Jobs** → pull account and entitlement data into SailPoint.  
- **Provisioning Policies** → define how to create/update accounts in the target system.  
- **Schema** → structure of accounts/entitlements in the source.  
- **Connectivity Health** → monitoring to ensure connectors run reliably.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
[ Source System ] <---(Connector)---> [ SailPoint ]
       |                                    |
  Accounts, Entitlements             Identities, Policies,
                                     Provisioning Actions
```

1. Connector aggregates accounts and entitlements from the source.  
2. SailPoint links them to identities using correlation rules.  
3. Provisioning requests from SailPoint flow back through the connector to the source.  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
- Workday is configured as an **authoritative source**.  
- SailPoint aggregates new hires, updates, and terminations from Workday.  
- Active Directory, Salesforce, and ServiceNow are added as non-authoritative sources.  
- Connectors provision new accounts in these systems when a new hire is detected.  
- Result → Day 1 access for employees, automatic deprovisioning on termination.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Misconfigured schema | Breaks aggregation or provisioning |
| Over-reliance on custom connectors | Increases maintenance burden |
| Not designating authoritative sources | Causes duplicate or orphan identities |
| Skipping connector health monitoring | Leads to unnoticed sync failures |

---

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What is the difference between a **source** and a **connector** in SailPoint?  
2. Why is an authoritative source important?  
3. Name two types of connectors available in SailPoint.  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
**Sources** are the systems SailPoint manages, and **connectors** are the technical bridges to those systems. Together, they make SailPoint an enterprise-wide identity governance platform.
