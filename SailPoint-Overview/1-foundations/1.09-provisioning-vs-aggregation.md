# 🏆 Section 1.09 | Foundations | “Provisioning vs Aggregation”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
Two of the most important processes in SailPoint are **Provisioning** and **Aggregation**.  
They represent the “push” and “pull” mechanisms that keep identities and accounts in sync between SailPoint and connected systems.  

Confusing the two leads to design mistakes, so let’s break them down clearly.  

---

## 🏢 Core Explanation

### Aggregation (Pull)
- **Definition** → SailPoint **pulls data** from connected sources.  
- Purpose → keep SailPoint updated with the latest accounts, entitlements, and attributes.  
- Example: SailPoint runs a daily aggregation job on Active Directory to pull in all new accounts, groups, and changes.  

### Provisioning (Push)
- **Definition** → SailPoint **pushes changes** to connected sources.  
- Purpose → create, update, or remove accounts and entitlements in target systems.  
- Example: When a new hire is detected in Workday, SailPoint provisions accounts in Active Directory and Salesforce.  

### Why They Work Together
- Aggregation ensures SailPoint **knows the truth**.  
- Provisioning ensures SailPoint **enforces the truth**.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Aggregation Jobs** → scheduled tasks that pull source data.  
- **Provisioning Policies** → define how to create/update accounts.  
- **Identity Correlation** → stitches aggregated accounts to identities.  
- **Event Triggers** (in ISC) → allow real-time provisioning events.  
- **Workflows** → automate provisioning flows with approvals, triggers, and exception handling.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
        [ Aggregation ]
 Source ----> SailPoint  ----> Target System
             (Identity)        [ Provisioning ]
```

1. Aggregation pulls account/entitlement data into SailPoint.  
2. Identities are updated and correlated.  
3. Provisioning pushes changes (create, modify, disable) to the target system.  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
- Aggregation: A new group is created in Salesforce. SailPoint pulls it in during the next aggregation run so it appears in the catalog.  
- Provisioning: A manager approves a request for an employee to join that group. SailPoint provisions the group membership into Salesforce.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Running aggregation too infrequently | Delays identity updates |
| Overlapping provisioning policies | Causes duplicate accounts |
| No monitoring on failed jobs | Silent failures lead to compliance gaps |
| Confusing provisioning with aggregation | Leads to broken workflows and missed updates |

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What is the main difference between aggregation and provisioning?  
2. Why is aggregation necessary before provisioning works properly?  
3. How does ISC improve provisioning speed compared to IIQ?  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
**Aggregation pulls data in. Provisioning pushes changes out.** Together, they ensure SailPoint stays accurate and keeps target systems aligned.
