# 🏆 Section 1.01 | Foundations | “What is SailPoint?”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
SailPoint is one of the leading platforms for **Identity Security**.  
It helps organizations answer three critical questions:
- Who has access?  
- Should they have it?  
- How is it being used?  

The platform provides two main products:
- **Identity Security Cloud (ISC)** → cloud-first, SaaS platform  
- **IdentityIQ (IIQ)** → on-premise solution, older but still widely used  

Understanding SailPoint at a high level is the starting point for mastering identity governance, lifecycle management, and compliance.

---

## 🏢 Core Explanation
At its core, SailPoint is about **governing and controlling digital identities**.  

Key purposes:
- Manage **users, accounts, and entitlements** across systems  
- Automate **provisioning** (granting/removing access)  
- Ensure **compliance** with audits and regulations  
- Provide **insight** into who has access to what and why  

### Identity Security Cloud (ISC)
- SaaS delivery, continuously updated by SailPoint  
- Uses modern APIs, event triggers, and integrations  
- Strong dashboards and reporting  
- Quicker to deploy and scale  

### IdentityIQ (IIQ)
- Installed and managed on-premises  
- Provides deep customization through rules and Beanshell scripts  
- Heavier lift for upgrades and maintenance

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Identity** → the digital representation of a person in SailPoint  
- **Account** → credentials on a connected system (e.g., AD, SAP)  
- **Entitlement** → fine-grained permission within an account  
- **Access Profile** → bundle of entitlements, easier to request  
- **Role** → logical grouping of access for a job function  
- **Policy** → rules to enforce compliance (e.g., no SoD conflicts)

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow
High-level lifecycle in SailPoint:

```
[ HR / Source System ] --> [ SailPoint ] --> [ Applications ]
       |                       |                  |
   Hire/Update/Leave     Identity Created     Access Provisioned/Revoked
```

- New hire in HR system → SailPoint creates identity  
- Identity is correlated with accounts in systems  
- Provisioning grants required entitlements automatically  
- Certifications and policies keep access aligned over time  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
A new employee joins a company:  
- HR system sends details to SailPoint  
- SailPoint creates the identity in ISC  
- Based on role, the employee gets accounts in Active Directory and Salesforce  
- Entitlements are bundled in access profiles so the employee is ready on Day 1  
- If the employee leaves, SailPoint automatically revokes all access

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Treating ISC and IIQ as interchangeable | They share concepts but deployment, customization, and scaling differ greatly |
| Skipping identity correlation | Leads to duplicate or orphan accounts |
| Over-customizing IIQ | Makes upgrades painful and error-prone |
| Ignoring SoD policies | Creates compliance violations |

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What is the difference between SailPoint ISC and IIQ?  
2. Which object represents the **digital person** in SailPoint?  
3. What happens in SailPoint when an employee leaves the company?  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
SailPoint provides the **foundation of identity security** by ensuring identities are created, managed, and revoked consistently across all systems, with ISC as the modern SaaS focus.
