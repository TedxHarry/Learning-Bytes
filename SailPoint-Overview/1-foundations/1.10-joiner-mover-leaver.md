# 🏆 Section 1.10 | Foundations | “Joiner, Mover, Leaver in SailPoint”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
Every organization must manage the **employee lifecycle**: onboarding new hires, handling job changes, and deprovisioning leavers.  
In SailPoint, this is known as **JML (Joiner, Mover, Leaver)**.  

SailPoint automates JML to ensure people always have the **right access at the right time**.

## 🏢 Core Explanation

### Joiner
- Triggered when a new hire or contractor is added in an authoritative source (like Workday or SuccessFactors).  
- SailPoint provisions accounts and entitlements automatically.  
- Access is usually based on role, department, and job function.  
- Goal → “Day 1 access” with no delays.  

### Mover
- Triggered when an existing user changes role, department, or location.  
- Old access that is no longer relevant must be removed.  
- New access is assigned based on updated attributes.  
- Prevents **access creep** by revoking outdated entitlements.  

### Leaver
- Triggered when someone leaves the company (termination in HR system).  
- All accounts are disabled or deprovisioned.  
- Critical for **security** (no lingering access) and **compliance**.  

### Why JML Matters
- Reduces manual IT work.  
- Protects against insider threats.  
- Ensures employees remain productive without over-provisioning.

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Authoritative Source** → usually HR system that feeds join/move/leave events.  
- **Workflows** (in ISC) → automate provisioning and deprovisioning flows.  
- **Provisioning Policies** → define how accounts are created or removed.  
- **Correlation Rules** → ensure updates affect the correct identity.  
- **Termination Triggers** → instantly disable high-risk accounts.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
[ HR System ]
     |
   Event (Hire / Change / Terminate)
     |
  [ SailPoint JML Workflow ]
     |
Provision Accounts / Update Roles / Disable Access
```

1. HR event triggers SailPoint workflow.  
2. SailPoint evaluates policies and roles.  
3. Accounts are provisioned, updated, or revoked automatically.  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
- **Joiner**: A new employee starts in Finance. SailPoint provisions AD, SAP, and Tableau accounts on Day 1.  
- **Mover**: The same employee moves from Finance to HR. Finance access is revoked, HR access is provisioned.  
- **Leaver**: The employee resigns. SailPoint disables all accounts immediately on the termination date.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Missing leaver automation | Leads to orphan accounts and security risks |
| Movers not revoking old access | Causes access creep |
| Weak correlation rules | Wrong accounts may be disabled |
| Delayed HR feeds | Access persists after termination |
