# 🏆 Section 1.03 | Foundations | “Identity Object (ISC) and Identity Cube (IIQ)”

---

## 📖 Intro / Context
SailPoint revolves around the concept of a **central identity record**.  
- In **ISC (Identity Security Cloud)** this is the **Identity Object**.  
- In **IIQ (IdentityIQ)** this is called the **Identity Cube**.  

Both represent the *single source of truth* for a person’s digital identity in the system, but the implementation differs.  

---

## 🏢 Core Explanation

### Identity Object (ISC)
- The heart of SailPoint’s cloud platform.  
- Stores all attributes about the person (name, email, department, manager, status, etc.).  
- Links to accounts, entitlements, and roles in connected systems.  
- Updated automatically through authoritative sources and event triggers.  
- JSON-based data structure, easily integrated via APIs.  

### Identity Cube (IIQ)
- Equivalent structure in IIQ.  
- Stores attributes and relationships for each identity.  
- Often updated through scheduled aggregation jobs.  
- Represented in a database-backed model.  
- Customizable via Beanshell rules for special cases.  

### Shared Goal
Both ensure that **all accounts and access link back to a single, authoritative person**.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Components
- **Attributes** → identity-level data (email, department, status).  
- **Links** → accounts that belong to the identity.  
- **Entitlements** → permissions within those accounts.  
- **Roles** → collections of access assigned to the identity.  
- **Policies** → compliance rules applied against identities.

## 🔄 How It Works / Flow

```
            [ Authoritative Source (HR) ]
                        |
               +--------+---------+
               | Identity Object |
               +--------+---------+
                        |
    -------------------------------------------------
    |                        |                      |
[ Account in AD ]     [ Account in SAP ]     [ Account in Salesforce ]
    |                        |                      |
 [ Entitlements ]       [ Entitlements ]       [ Entitlements ]
```

- HR system provides base attributes.  
- SailPoint builds the identity object (ISC) or cube (IIQ).  
- Accounts are linked back to that single identity.  
- Policies and certifications run on this unified model.  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example
Employee **Maria** joins Finance:  
- HR system sends her details → SailPoint creates an identity.  
- Maria’s accounts:  
  - `maria.ad` in Active Directory  
  - `maria_fi` in SAP  
  - `maria.sales` in Salesforce  
- All accounts are linked into **one Identity Object/Cube**.  
- Policies enforce that she doesn’t get conflicting entitlements (e.g., create and approve payments).

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls / Risks
| Pitfall | Why It’s a Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| Not aggregating all sources | Leads to incomplete identity objects |
| Weak account correlation | Causes orphan or duplicate identities |
| Over-customization in IIQ | Increases technical debt |
| Ignoring attribute mappings | Breaks downstream provisioning |

---

## 📝 Self-Check
1. What is the equivalent of an **Identity Object** in IIQ?  
2. What kind of data is stored in an identity record?  
3. Why is correlation important in building the identity object?  

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
The **Identity Object (ISC)** and **Identity Cube (IIQ)** represent the **single authoritative person** in SailPoint. They link all accounts, entitlements, and roles to ensure governance, compliance, and automation work correctly.
