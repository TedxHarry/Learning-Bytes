# 🏆 Section 1.1 | Foundations | “What is SCIM?”

---

## 📌 At a glance
SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) is an **open standard** that makes sure user accounts are created, updated, and removed consistently across different applications.  

Think of it as a **universal language for identity data**, instead of every app speaking its own dialect, they all agree to speak SCIM.  

---

## 📖 What is SCIM?
SCIM defines **how identity data looks** (attributes like `userName` and `emails`) and **how it moves** (messages like “create this user” or “disable this account”).  

- RFC 7643 → what identity data looks like (the schema).  
- RFC 7644 → how identity data is exchanged (the protocol).  
- Two main resources → **Users** and **Groups**.  
- Adopted by major SaaS vendors → Salesforce, Slack, Zoom, Okta, Entra ID.  

---

## 🌟 How SCIM works in practice

### Alice joins the company
1. HR adds Alice in Workday (HR system).  
2. The Identity Provider (IdP), like Okta or Azure AD, notices the new record.  
3. The IdP sends a SCIM **create user request** (`POST /Users`).  
4. Zoom (the app) receives the request and automatically creates Alice’s account.  

### 🌟 ASCII flow
```
HR System ──> IdP ──(SCIM POST /Users)──> Application
```

### 🌟 When Alice leaves
- HR marks Alice as terminated.  
- IdP sends SCIM **disable request** (`PATCH active:false`).  
- Zoom disables Alice’s account instantly.  

👉 No IT tickets. No orphaned accounts. No delays.  

---

## 📖 Glossary
- **IdP (Identity Provider)** → system that manages identity data (Okta, Entra ID).  
- **SP (Service Provider)** → app you want access to (Salesforce, Zoom).  
- **Provisioning** → creating accounts.  
- **Deprovisioning** → disabling or removing accounts.  
- **Schema** → the agreed structure of identity data.  

---

## ❗ Problem before SCIM
- Each app needed a custom connector.  
- Attribute mismatches caused confusion (e.g., “John.Smith” vs “jsmith”).  
- Manual IT tickets → onboarding took days.  
- Orphaned accounts after offboarding → security and compliance gaps.  

---

## 🔑 Key characteristics
### 1. How data looks  
- **Schemas** → standard attributes like `userName`, `emails`, `groups`.  

### 2. How systems talk  
- **REST + JSON** → simple, lightweight, easy to debug.  

### 3. How it helps  
- **Automation-first** → reduces IT workload.  
- **Lifecycle support** → handles joiners, movers, leavers.  
- **Interoperability** → one connector works for many apps.  
- **Secure deprovisioning** → clean account removal.  

---

## 🌍 Why it matters
- **IAM relevance**: SCIM is the modern standard for provisioning.  
- **Governance**: Automates offboarding, closes compliance gaps.  
- **Security**: Prevents ex-employee access.  
- **Audit readiness**: Every identity change is logged.  
- **Career**: SCIM expertise is a must for IAM and cloud security roles.  

---

## 🛠️ Typical lifecycle in action
- **Joiner** → `POST /Users`  
- **Mover** → `PATCH /Users`  
- **Leaver** → `PATCH active:false` or `DELETE /Users`  

❌ Without SCIM → delays, errors, orphaned accounts.  
✅ With SCIM → real-time provisioning, consistency, compliance.

## ⚙️ (Optional) Technical deep dive
*Skip this if you’re new — this is for readers who want to see the raw SCIM calls.*  

### Minimal user creation
```http
POST /Users
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"],
  "userName": "jane.doe",
  "name": { "givenName": "Jane", "familyName": "Doe" },
  "emails": [{ "value": "jane.doe@example.com", "primary": true }]
}
```

➡️ Plain English: “Create a user Jane Doe with this email.”  

---

## 🏢 Real-world example
Before SCIM:  
- IT manually created 3,000 accounts per month, taking 3–5 days.  
- 8% of ex-employees still had active accounts.  

After SCIM:  
- Offboarding took under 10 minutes across 15 apps.  
- Compliance audit passed, IT workload reduced by 70%.  

---

## ❌ Common pitfalls
- Forgetting the `schemas` field.  
- Assuming all vendors support `PATCH` (some only use PUT).  
- Using `DELETE` instead of `active:false` → audit trail lost.  
- Case-sensitive `userName` mismatches.  

---

## ⚠️ Risks & issues

| Risk | Impact | Fix |
|------|--------|-----|
| Partial SCIM support | Requests may fail silently | Check `/ServiceProviderConfig` |
| Attribute mismap | Wrong access granted | Test with pilot users |
| Failed deprovision | Orphaned accounts | Monitor logs, retry |
| Overuse of DELETE | Permanent data loss | Prefer `active:false` |

## 🎤 Interview prep questions
1. **Explain the role of SCIM in the joiner–mover–leaver lifecycle. Why is deprovisioning critical from a security standpoint?**  
2. **How does SCIM differ from using a vendor’s custom API for provisioning, and what advantages does SCIM provide in an enterprise environment?**
